<p align="center">Node.js Detox with the power of Go and HTMX</p>

## Motivation

Bid farewell to Node.js complexities and marvel at the simplicity of our
project, where we gracefully sidestep the unnecessary. 

Because, let's be honest, who needs the drama of Node.js when you can smoothly
'Go' without it and 'HTMX'-plore a world of serene backend coding?

## How to run this bad boy

1. Clone this guy
```sh
git clone https://github.com/ydkulks/GoBeyondJS
```
2. Once you install Golang, run this to get your server up and running:
```sh
cd ./path/to/repo
go run cmd/main.go
```
3. Once you have installed Node.js (I know, I know), run this for front-end to work:
```sh
npm run dev
```
4. Open localhost with :8000 port to view the page
```sh
# Come on! You can do this. You don't need my help here üëç
```
